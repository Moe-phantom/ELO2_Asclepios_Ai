# Asclepios AI: Optimizing Substance Use Disorder Treatment

Welcome to the Asclepios AI project! This repository contains all the work
done by our team to develop an AI-powered platform that helps substance use
disorder (SUD) treatment facilities optimize patient care and resource
allocation.

## 🌟 What We're Building

We're creating a smart system that helps treatment centers:

- Predict how long each patient needs treatment for the best chance of recovery
- Reduce the number of patients who return after treatment (readmissions)
- Make the most of their available resources (beds, staff, time)

Think of it like a personalized recommendation system - just like how Netflix
recommends movies you might like, our system recommends the optimal treatment
plan for each patient based on their unique situation.

## 👥 Our Team

This project is being developed by a collaborative team:

- **Caesar Ghazi** ([@CaesarGhazi](https://github.com/CaesarGhazi))
- **Moe Alwathiq** ([Moe-phantom](https://github.com/Moe-phantom))
- **Rafaa Ali** ([@RafaaAli](https://github.com/RafaaAli))
- **Wuor Bhang** ([@WuorBhang](https://github.com/WuorBhang))

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Substance use disorders affect millions of people worldwide and cost society
billions of dollars each year. Unfortunately:

- About 30% of patients return to treatment within a year
- Treatment facilities struggle to match the right treatment length to each
  patient
- Resources are often wasted or underused due to poor planning

Our AI system aims to solve these problems by using data to make better
predictions about what each patient needs.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Our work is organized in a step-by-step approach:

```/
├── 0_domain_study/            # Research about SUD treatment and AI applications
├── 1_datasets/                # The data we're using to train our AI models
├── 2_data_preparation/        # Cleaning and organizing the data
├── 3_data_exploration/        # Understanding patterns in the data
├── 4_data_analysis/           # Building and testing our AI models
├── 5_communication_strategy/  # How we'll share our findings with others
├── 6_final_presentation/      # Our final presentation materials
└── collaboration/             # Team agreements, schedules, and reflections

```

## 📊 Data Sources

We're using publicly available datasets from reputable sources:

- **Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS)**: Information about admissions to
  substance abuse treatment facilities
- **National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)**: Annual survey data about
  drug use and mental health in the U.S.

All data is handled ethically and with respect for patient privacy.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

If you're interested in our work, you can:

1. **Explore our research** in the [0_domain_study](./0_domain_study/) folder
2. **See our data** in the [1_datasets](./1_datasets/) folder
3. **Learn about our approach** by reading the README files in each folder
4. **Follow our progress** through our collaboration documents

Each folder contains a README.md file that explains what's in that section in
plain language.
